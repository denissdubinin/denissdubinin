# About Me

Hi, I'm Deniss, a passionate learner and software developer from Hangzhou, China. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on [**FINEYO**](https://fineyo.app/) - Budget Manager and Expense Tracker for iOS
- üìë The first CMS I used was UCOZ hosting with built-in CMS, a few years later I migrated to self-hosted DLE
- üéâ At 16 I launched a website with 30,000 unique visitors per day
- üêà I love cats

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è A bit more about me

I‚Äôve been passionate about web development since I was 12 when I first started exploring various free CMSs. Initially drawn to frontend development, I later discovered my love for backend development, which I found equally fascinating. Through self-education, I launched my first standalone website at 13 and later started a small agency specializing in custom designs and solutions for a prominent web platform. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on a variety of projects including music platforms, news portals, large ecommerce stores, forums, mobile applications, and SaaS products.

I enjoy coding, staying up-to-date with new tech trends, and writing clean, efficient code that follows industry standards and best practices. I take pride in doing my work well and being someone people can rely on.
